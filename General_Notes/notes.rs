    - Chapters Skipped: 7, 9 (panic!), 11, 12, 14

    - C++ Users
        - Data (w/o the Copy trait) which are shallow copied demonstrate weak pointers
        - Data (w/o the Copy trait) moved to a fn use move semantics (&&)
        - Data (w/o the Copy trait) passed as a mutable reference act like a shared pointer... deleted on end of fn

    - Python Users
        - Syntax is similar
            - The match statement
            - Function signatures
            - Staticmethod Ctors (impl fn without self -> Self)
            - Tuple packing and unpacking
            - Enumeration/iteration
            - Dataclasses written using Structs 

    - Scalar Types: integers, floating-pt, booleans, and chars

    - Numeric overflows caught in debug compiler mode, not release mode

    - Most control flow expressions dont require (), but require {}

    - Let If statements must have the same branch value types

    - The String type actually has an internal pointer... shallow copy doesnt copy this pointer
        - Shallow copy (assignments) might cause a lifetime compilation error
        - Use references (&String) or string views/literals (&str)
        - A &str covers both references to strings and literals
    
    - Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection

    - Primitive data types (ones that have the Copy Trait implemented) are deep copied by default
        - Means you don't have to worry about lifetime errors
        - Data types can't have both the Copy and Drop Traits implemented (IMPORTANT)
    
    - Ownership
        - Can only have one mutable reference (without any const references)
        - Can have any amount of const references (without any mutable reference) 

    - Structs
        - If the instance is mutable, all fields must be mutable
        - (IMPORTANT) Using another instance to build a template... unless referenced, the data is moved to the new struct
            - This means the previous struct instance field that was moved can't use it!

    - Enums (Enumerations) -> iterates possible variants
        - Enums are namespaced under its identifier/scope

    - Rust errors
        - recoverable -> Result<T, E>
            - enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E), }
            - The ? placed after a Result value is defined to work in almost the same way as the match expressions
            - (IMPORTANT)  If the value is an Err, the Err will be returned from the whole function 
                as if we had used the return keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling code.
            - (IMPORTANT) The ? operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the ? is used on
            - Error values that have the ? operator called on them go through the from function, defined in the From trait in the standard library, 
                which is used to convert values from one type into another. When the ? operator calls the from function, 
                the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function. 
                This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent all the ways a function might fail, 
                even if parts might fail for many different reasons.
        - unrecoverable -> panic!
            - Use of either .expect('ERR MSG') or .unwrap()

    - Generics
        - Template specialization isn't supported yet, but could be in the future with #![feature(specialization)]
        - Can declare generic parameters in three places: in the struct, in the impl head, and in the fn definitions 
        - A trait defines the fxnality a particular type has and can share with other types
            - Trait bounds specifies how a generic type can be any type with a certain behavior 
            - Traits may be called interfaces in other languages
            - A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type
            - One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type (struct) only if either the trait or the type (struct), 
                or both, are local to our crate.
            - Python Users: trait overriding is common in MRO defined inheritance
                - Optional override for default implementations
            - Python Users: trait bounds is actually 3.12+ typing for fxns/methods. Both can be omitted
                - When is a trait bounds necessary? Good question, generally, if you need to specify bounded trait inputs
                    - Isnt that redundantly inherent..? Yes, yes it is.
                    - For Rust, the trait bounds should be preferred over parameter bounding when multiple traits per parameter are used,
                        or redundant traits are used
            - Trait bounds is the same as the where clause. Use the where clause when appropriate
            - Two types of generic implementations for a trait bound: blanket implementation and conditional implementation

    - Borrow Checker
        - Compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid
        - Lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various parameters and return values of functions
        - (IMPORTANT) Deterministic lifetime patterns are inferred by the compiler (called lifetime elision rules)
        - Compiler Rules
            1. Each referenced parameter gets it's own lifetime
            2. If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
            3. If there is a reference to self (&self or &mut self), the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
        - Static lifetimes live the duration of the program's life

    - Type Aliases: similar to Python 3.12's type keyword

    Three Ways To Instantiate A Struct
        1. Building from scratch: all are new
        2. Building from other by name: unless referenced, the data is moved to the new struct. 
            - This means the previous struct instance field that was moved can't use it!
        3. Building from other by ellipsis: same as by name. unless referenced, the data is moved to the new struct. 
            - This means the previous struct instance field that was moved can't use it!
            - The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.
